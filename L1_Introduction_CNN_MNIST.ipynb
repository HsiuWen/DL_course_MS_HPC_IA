The layer is completely specified by a certain number of kernels, $\\bf \\vec{K}$ (along with additive biases, $\\vec{b}$, per each kernel), and it operates by computing the convolution of the output images of a previous layer with each of those kernels, afterwards adding the biases (one per each output image). Finally, an activation function, $\\sigma$, may be applied to all of the pixels of the output images. Typically, the input to a convolutional layer will have $d$ *channels* (e.g. red/green/blue in the input layer), in which case the kernels are extended to have this number of channels as well, making the final formula of a single output image channel of a convolutional layer (for a kernel ${\\bf K}$ and bias $b$) as follows:\n",

        "\n",
        "It is important to note that, while a convolutional layer significantly decreases the number of *parameters* compared to a fully connected (FC) layer, it introduces more **hyperparameters**---parameters whose values need to be chosen *before* training starts.\n",

        "- *height* and *width* of each kernel;\n",

This specifies the overlap between individual output pixels, and typically it is set to $1$, corresponding to the formula given before. Note that larger strides result in smaller output sizes.\n",
        "- *padding*: note that convolution by any kernel larger than $1\\times 1$ will *decrease* the output image size---it is often desirable to keep sizes the same, in which case the image is sufficiently padded with zeroes at the edges. This is often called *\"same\"* padding, as opposed to *\"valid\"* (no) padding. It is possible to add arbitrary levels of padding, but typically the padding of choice will be either same or valid.\n",

I did not draw the activation functions here to make the sketch clearer, but do keep in mind that typically after every convolutional or fully connected layer, an activation (e.g. ReLU) will be applied to all of the outputs.\n",

For summarisation purposes, a softmax layer's purpose is converting any vector of real numbers into a vector of *probabilities* (nonnegative real values that add up to 1). Within this context, the probabilities correspond to the likelihoods that an input image is a member of a particular class. Minimising the cross-entropy loss has the effect of maximising the model's confidence in the *correct* class, without being concerned for the probabilites for other classes---this makes it a more suitable choice for probabilistic tasks compared to, for example, the squared error loss."

        "This will be the first (and hopefully the only) time when I will divert your attention to a seemingly unrelated topic. It regards a very important pitfall of machine learning---**overfitting** a model to the training data. While this is primarily going to be a major topic of the next tutorial in the series, the negative effects of overfitting will tend to become quite noticeable on the networks like the one we are about to build, and we need to introduce a way to properly protect ourselves against it, before going any further. Luckily, there is a very simple technique we can use.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overfitting corresponds to adapting our model to the training set to such extremes that its generalisation potential (performance on samples outside of the training set) is *severely* limited. In other words, our model might have learned the training set (along with any noise present within it) perfectly, but it has failed to capture the underlying process that generated it. To illustrate, consider a problem of fitting a sine curve, with white additive noise applied to the data points: \n",

        "\n",
        "Here we have a training set (denoted by blue circles) derived from the original sine wave, along with some noise. If we fit a degree-3 polynomial to this data, we get a fairly good approximation to the original curve. Someone might argue that a degree-14 polynomial would do better; indeed, given we have 15 points, such a fit would *perfectly* describe the training data. However, in this case, the additional parameters of the model cause catastrophic results: to cope with the inherent noise of the data, anywhere except in the closest vicinity of the training points, our fit is completely off.\n",
        "\n",
        "Deep convolutional neural networks have a large number of parameters, especially in the fully connected layers. Overfitting might often manifest in the following form: if we don't have sufficiently many training examples, a small group of neurons might become responsible for doing most of the processing and other neurons becoming redundant; or in the other extreme, some neurons might actually become detrimental to performance, with several other neurons of their layer ending up doing nothing else but correcting for their errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "To help our models generalise better in these circumstances, we introduce techniques of *regularisation*: rather than reducing the number of parameters, we impose *constraints* on the model parameters during training to keep them from learning the noise in the training data. The particular method I will introduce here is **dropout**---a technique that initially might seem like \"dark magic\", but actually helps to eliminate exactly the failure modes described above. Namely, dropout with parameter $p$ will, within a single training iteration, go through all neurons in a particular layer and, with probability $p$, *completely eliminate them from the network throughout the iteration*. This has the effect of forcing the neural network to cope with *failures*, and not to rely on existence of a particular neuron (or set of neurons)---relying more on a *consensus* of several neurons within a layer. This is a very simple technique that works quite well already for combatting overfitting on its own, without introducing further regularisers. An illustration is given below.\n",

        "Modelling time! Our network has an architecture similar to LeNet5 of LeCun (see figure below). It will consist of two consecutive groups of one `Convolution2D` followed by  a `MaxPooling2D` layer. After the first pooling layer, the number of kernels is rougly doubled (in line with the previously mentioned principle of sacrificing height and width for more depth). Afterwards, the output of the second pooling layer is flattened to 1D (via the `Flatten` layer), and passed through one or two fully connected (`Dense`) layers. ReLU activations will once again be used for all layers except the output dense layer, which will use a softmax activation (for purposes of probabilistic classification).\n",

        "To regularise our model, a `Dropout` layer is applied after each pooling layer, and after the first `Dense` layer. This is another area where Keras shines compared to other frameworks: it has an internal flag that automatically enables or disables dropout, depending on whether the model is currently used for training or testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "The remainder of the model specification is the following:\n",
        "- We use the *cross-entropy* loss function as the objective to optimise (as its derivation is more appropriate for probabilistic tasks);\n",
        "- We use the [*Adam* optimiser for gradient descent](http://sebastianruder.com/optimizing-gradient-descent/);\n",
        "- We report the *accuracy* of the model (as the dataset is balanced across the ten classes)\\*;\n",
        "- We hold out 10% of the data for validation purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\\* To get a feeling for why accuracy might be inappropriate for unbalanced datasets, consider an extreme case where 90% of the test data belongs to class $x$ (this could be, for example, the task of diagnosing patients for an extremely rare disease). In this case, a classifier that just outputs $x$ achieves a seemingly impressive accuracy of 90% on the test data, without really doing any learning/generalisation."
